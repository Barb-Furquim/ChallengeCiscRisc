  * Challenge description:
  
    -> Create an initial menu with the options: Deposit, Withdrawal, Consultation and exit, in the latter case leaving the operation without choosing any of the options.
    
    -> The menu needs to be repeated if the user types a key other than those offered in the menu. If he types the exit option, print a goodbye message.
    
    -> You can use the structures used in class, such as if/else, switch/case, for, while and do-while. 
    
    -> A MANDATORY requirement is a function other than main().
    
    -> It will be necessary to create 2 structures, that is, 2 files. They will have to be different, with one targeting the CISC architecture and the other targeting RISC.
    
    -> Don't forget to manage memories by correctly typing the variables.
